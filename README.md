>> HACKATON 2018

The security of developments is a complex subject. It's hard to imagine that the software is a day
totally replace the human mind in this area. However, many analytical tools


The application we are developing in this challenge is to make the most of these
many tools and offer a complete and user-friendly application.

The principle is simple: a user indicates the address of the GitHub repository of his project written in PHP in a
form field and the application generate a report after analyzing the code of this project.
If the principle is simple, the implementation remains complex and requires architecture and infrastructure
well created. That's the whole point of this challenge. Among the different needs and technological constraints that
you identify, we make the choice to impose certain mechanisms and technological bricks:
- A forehead developed with Meteor to promote hybrid porting
- PHP API backend developed with Laravel
- Asynchronous processing of analytical jobs
- Sending transactional emails to inform the user of the processing steps of their project
- The possibility to collect donations in euros, bitcoin and ether to finance the project
- A technical stack based on Docker to promote scalability
In addition to the basic features above, all the functional features will be the
Welcome (account user history of reports, stats use of the service for administrators, ...).
It's up to you to be proactive.
